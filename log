Made git repo, installed msysgit
Made first commit
	README.txt
Connected project to studentserver, for testing enviroment
The chatserver will be run on jane.graveraven.net
Created index.php, mostly empty right now

Todo:
	look into what other chats can do and make list of things to add
	take old js-code and see if it can be cleaned up
	insert comments into old js-code
	change readme to .md (learn a bit markdown)

Ideas so far:
	Proper userlist, that updates on connect/disconnect
		- send userlist when that happens, make client update contents
		able to double-click to start private msg
	Channels
		/join, /part, /leave
		- channellist
		- connect users and channels
		- when command is sent, also send which window/channel was active
	User-levels
		op, voice, ownership
		autoop, autovoice
		- files with userlevels
		- files with users connected to channels
	Make server notifications more clear, split into categories maybe?
		Make them appear in either status or active window?
		- create different message types OR add propery to JSON: toWindow
	Channels and private messages require different windows
		How to handle this?
	Auto-link url's in chat
	Add colors for different kind of messags/notifications
		Maybe add color choices for each user?
	Add chat history?
		Log-files?
	Create max-buffer for windows

Sketching on userlist and channellist
For now: focus on making the server work when it's online
	no file-backup stuff just yet - look into that later
Made list of commands

Ideas:
	/nick command for registering and stuff?
		how does server remember?
	add ban/kick to channels - op only
	/ignore
	/whois ?
	/list - list all channels
	/names #channel - list names in channel
		with argument - arg = channel
		without argument - for active channel
	/topic - channel topic, op only
		with argument - set topic
		without argument - view topic

Should channels know which users have special levels or should it be saved with
	the user? Probably channel. Only keep track of op/voice
Keep track of channel<->user in both channel and user?
Max msg lenght?
max nick lenght?

Commands:
	/help [command]
		no arg: list commands
	/msg nick text
	/me [text]
	/nick nick
	/ignore [nick]
		no arg: list ignores
	/unignore nick
	/whois nick
	/slap nick
	/list
	/names [channel]
		no arg: list users in active channel
	/join channel
	/part [text]
	/leave
	/topic [text]
		no arg: view topic
	/op nick [nick+]
	/voice nick [nick+]
	/kick nick [text]
	/ban nick [text]
