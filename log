Made git repo, installed msysgit
Made first commit
	README.txt
Connected project to studentserver, for testing enviroment
The chatserver will be run on jane.graveraven.net
Created index.php, mostly empty right now

Todo:
	look into what other chats can do and make list of things to add
	take old js-code and see if it can be cleaned up
	insert comments into old js-code
	change readme to .md (learn a bit markdown)

Ideas so far:
	Proper userlist, that updates on connect/disconnect
		- send userlist when that happens, make client update contents
		able to double-click to start private msg
	Channels
		/join, /part, /leave
		- channellist
		- connect users and channels
		- when command is sent, also send which window/channel was active
	User-levels
		op, voice, ownership
		autoop, autovoice
		- files with userlevels
		- files with users connected to channels
	Make server notifications more clear, split into categories maybe?
		Make them appear in either status or active window?
		- create different message types OR add propery to JSON: toWindow
	Channels and private messages require different windows
		How to handle this?
	Auto-link url's in chat
	Add colors for different kind of messags/notifications
		Maybe add color choices for each user?
	Add chat history?
		Log-files?
	Create max-buffer for windows
