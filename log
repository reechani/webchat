Made git repo, installed msysgit
Made first commit
	README.txt
Connected project to studentserver, for testing enviroment
The chatserver will be run on jane.graveraven.net
Created index.php, mostly empty right now

Todo:
	look into what other chats can do and make list of things to add
	take old js-code and see if it can be cleaned up
	insert comments into old js-code

Ideas so far:
	Proper userlist, that updates on connect/disconnect
		able to double-click to start private msg
	Channels
		/join, /part, /leave
	User-levels
		op, voice, ownership
		autoop, autovoice
	Make server notifications more clear, split into categories maybe?
		Make them appear in either status or active window?
	Channels and private messages require different windows
		How to handle this?
	Auto-link url's in chat
	Add colors for different kind of messags/notifications
	Maybe add color choices for each user?
	Add chat history?
	Log-files?
	Create max-buffer for windows
